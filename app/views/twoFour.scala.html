        <strong>Out of the box, Play provides runtime dependency injection based on JSR 330.</strong>
        Runtime dependency injection
        is so called because the dependency graph is created, wired and validated at runtime. If a dependency
        cannot be found for a particular component, you wonâ€™t get an error until you run your application.

    <p>
        <strong>Out of the box we provide and encourage the use of Guice for dependency injection</strong>, but many other
        dependency injection tools and techniques, including compile time dependency injection techniques
        in Scala are possible.

        One aim of dependency injection is to eliminate global state, such as singletons. Play 2 was designed
        with an assumption of global state. Play 3 will hopefully remove this global state,
        however that is a major breaking task. In the meantime, Play will be a bit of a hybrid state,
        with some parts not using global state, and other parts using global state.

        Compile time dependency injection looks different in Play 2.4:

        Mar 12: I'm pleased to announce the release of Play 2.4.0-M3!  This should be the last milestone before we go
        into the RC phase, and as with the other milestones, I want to stress that this release is still experimental,
        there are still things that can and will change between now and the RC phase, particularly in the area of
        configuration.  Do not upgrade your production application to this release, it's just for experimenting with.
