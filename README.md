# KISS-style DI with Play

Presentation about no framework dependency injection at the [Vienna Scala User Group][vsug].

Both the presentation and the code are in the [Play][play] application. Run it with `sbt run` or
`activator run` and point your favorite browser to [localhost:9000][playLocal].

Have a look at the [Meetup page][meetup201503] to see comments and photos.
